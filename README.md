# Generic UI

A bunch of generic/utility svelte components. Styled with tailwind. Instead of adding 300 more or less usable attributes. I tried to use `{...$$restProps}` in the best way. That should allow you (and me) to bind to/set/tweak any attribute needed, as well as overriding the class attribute.
