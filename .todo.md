# TODO

* Become more semantically correct when possible ;)

## Table
* Also create a headless component to back the table.
* Potentially make it more involved by accepting another list of columns, but not sure.

## Markdown
* Add a headless component to back this component, potentially replace it with headless variant.

## Toastlane
* Add a headless component to back this component, potentially replace it with headless variant.

## Navbar
* Navbar is alot more involved than it needs to be and forces consumer into a pre-defined behavior.
* Extract "toggle behavior" into headless component?
